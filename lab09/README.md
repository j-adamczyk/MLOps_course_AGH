## Lab 9 - Introduction to cloud computing

In this lab, we will create cloud infrastructure manually using the AWS Management Console. 
This exercise will help you understand the basic setup of key services, including S3, ECR, VPC, ALB and ECS. 
Learning how to configure these services manually builds the foundation for 
later automating them with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform.

**Learning plan**
1. Account setup & IAM configuration
2. Amazon S3 setup and file management
3. Elastic Container Registry (ECR) & Docker management
4. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration
5. AWS Fargate deployment & CloudWatch configuration
6. Application testing and monitoring

**Necessary software**
- Docker
- AWS account
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

**Lab & homework**

In this lab, there is no separate homework. Laboratory instructions are long and also act
as homework. See the [lab instruction](LAB_INSTRUCTION.md).
